Description: Provides functions to impute missing values using Gaussian 
    copulas for mixed data types as described by Christoffersen et al. 
    (2021) <arXiv:2102.02642>. The method is related to Hoff (2007) 
    <doi:10.1214/07-AOAS107> and Zhao and Udell (2019) <arXiv:1910.12845> 
    but differs by making a direct approximation of the log marginal likelihood 
    using an extended version of the Fortran code created by Genz and Bretz 
    (2002) <doi:10.1198/106186002394> in addition to also support multinomial 
    variables.
